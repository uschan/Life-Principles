# Zenith Protocol // Life Principles

A curated list of 26 profound life principles and their architectural analysis, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Project Structure

- **Core**: React 19 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API (Zenith Kernel)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To start the local development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Deployment

To generate a static production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The output files will be in the `dist` directory. You can serve this directory using Nginx, Apache, or any static file host on your VPS.

## API Key Configuration

This project uses the Google Gemini API.
For local development and production, ensure you have a valid API Key.

**Note**: The application is designed to verify the API key availability securely. For the frontend-only version, users may be prompted or you can configure a proxy if needed, though the current implementation is client-side focused.
